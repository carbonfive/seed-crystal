# Seed::Crystal

An opinionated, _tested_, workstation configuration tool -- From zero to productive

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/carbonfive/seed-crystal/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/carbonfive/seed-crystal/tree/master)

## Installation

```sh
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carbonfive/seed-crystal/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```

## Updates

```sh
cd ~/Documents/seed-crystal
git pull
sh bin/workstation-setup.sh
```

## Opt-ins

The base install is just enough to get you productive without too much ceremony, but what if you want to do mobile work? Or design work?

```sh
cd ~/Documents/seed-crystal
sh bin/mobile-setup.sh
sh bin/design-setup.sh
```

## Software Updates

Keeping your tools up-to-date is an every growing time suck. Not any more.

```sh
cd ~/Documents/seed-crystal
brew bundle check --verbose
brew bundle
```

## Core Values

1. Standard toolsets make it easier for contributors to roll onto a project. What you do on your personal projects is your business, but we are in the business of delivering value to our clients. There shall be no `vim`/`emacs` wars.

2. Default configurations unless there is a really good reason not to follow it.

3. Up and running *fast*.

4. If something is important enough to include, but you can't find unanimous agreement, pick something, anything and commit. Nobody dies because of a linter configuration choice. We can always come back and make it better.

5. Document rationale if at all possible. Document in `code` if at all possible.

6. Idempotent. At least non-destructive.

## Realities

- This script is probably run once per project _at best_. Worst case, it is done on your first day at work, and not again until your hardware is repurposed for someone else.

- It's hard to test perfectly: Wipe the laptop. Reinstall the OS. Run the script.

- Our world is broken up into somewhat orthogonal core competencies: RoR, React, Mobile, Elixir, Go. No one person will be an expert on all of these toolchains. Provide low-ceremony, low friction tools to help the experts decide what's important.
