# Seed::Crystal

An opinionated, _tested_, workstation configuration tool -- From zero to productive

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/carbonfive/seed-crystal/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/carbonfive/seed-crystal/tree/master)

## Installation

```sh
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carbonfive/seed-crystal/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```

## Opt-ins

The base install is just enough to get you productive without too much ceremony, but what if you want to do mobile work?
Or design work? Run one or more these setup scripts.

```sh
cd ~/Documents/seed-crystal
sh bin/design-setup.sh
sh bin/java-setup.sh
sh bin/mobile-setup.sh
sh bin/web-setup.sh
```

## Software Updates

Seed::Crystal remembers which set up packages you've already installed, and if you re-run the `bootstrap.sh` script,
then it will re-run all of the scripts that you've used before.

```sh
$ cd ~/Documents/seed-crystal
$ git pull
$ sh bootstrap.sh
Notice: This workstation has already been seeded. Re-running setup scripts.
Notice:
     1  bin/workstation-setup.sh
     2  bin/web-setup.sh
     3  bin/design-setup.sh
...
```

## Core Values

1. Standard toolsets make it easier for contributors to roll onto a project. What you do on your personal projects is your business, but we are in the business of delivering value to our clients. There shall be no `vim`/`emacs` wars.

2. Default configurations unless there is a really good reason not to follow it.

3. Up and running *fast*.

4. If something is important enough to include, but you can't find unanimous agreement, pick something, anything and commit. Nobody dies because of a linter configuration choice. We can always come back and make it better.

5. Document rationale if at all possible. Document in `code` if at all possible.

6. Idempotent. At least non-destructive.

## Realities

- This script is probably run once per project _at best_. Worst case, it is done on your first day at work, and not again until your hardware is repurposed for someone else.

- It's hard to test perfectly: Wipe the laptop. Reinstall the OS. Run the script.

- Our world is broken up into somewhat orthogonal core competencies: RoR, React, Mobile, Elixir, Go. No one person will be an expert on all of these toolchains. Provide low-ceremony, low friction tools to help the experts decide what's important.
